# 🐍 Python Refresh Practice Path

## 🔹 Phase 1 – Warm-Up (Basics & Syntax)

👉 Goal: Recall core Python syntax, control flow, and data types.

**Exercises:**

* Write a program that:

  * Prints “Hello, World”
  * Takes user input and prints it in uppercase.
  * Converts Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit.
* Write functions for:

  * Checking if a number is prime.
  * Reversing a string.
  * Calculating factorial (both loop & recursion).

---

## 🔹 Phase 2 – Data Structures

👉 Goal: Comfortably use lists, dicts, sets, tuples.

**Exercises:**

* Implement a to-do list using a Python list.
* Count word frequency in a paragraph using a dictionary.
* Remove duplicates from a list using a set.
* Write a tuple unpacking example (`x, y = (1, 2)`).

---

## 🔹 Phase 3 – Functions, Files & Modules

👉 Goal: Learn to organize code and handle files.

**Exercises:**

* Create a module `math_utils.py` with `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`.
* Read a text file and count how many times each word appears.
* Write to a CSV file and then read it back.

---

## 🔹 Phase 4 – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

👉 Goal: Refresh classes, inheritance, and OOP design.

**Exercises:**

* Class `BankAccount` with `deposit`, `withdraw`, `balance`.
* Class `Student` that inherits from `Person` and adds `gpa`.
* Implement `__str__` and `__repr__` methods for better printing.

---

## 🔹 Phase 5 – Error Handling & Pythonic Style

👉 Goal: Get used to writing clean, safe, and “Pythonic” code.

**Exercises:**

* Write a safe division function that handles divide-by-zero errors.
* Practice `with open(...) as f` for file handling.
* Rewrite a normal loop into a **list comprehension**.
* Use `enumerate()` and `zip()` in a loop.

---

## 🔹 Phase 6 – Intermediate Concepts

👉 Goal: Brush up on more powerful features.

**Exercises:**

* Create a **generator** that yields Fibonacci numbers.
* Write a **decorator** that logs function calls.
* Practice using `*args` and `**kwargs`.
* Create a **context manager** (custom class with `__enter__` and `__exit__`).

---

## 🔹 Phase 7 – Mini Projects

👉 Goal: Apply all basics in small useful scripts.

**Project Ideas:**

* **Expense Tracker** → add expenses, save to CSV, calculate total.
* **Quiz Game** → ask multiple-choice questions and score the user.
* **Weather Fetcher** → use `requests` to call an API (like OpenWeatherMap).
* **Text Analyzer** → count words, sentences, most common words in a file.

---

## 🔹 Phase 8 – Advanced Practice

👉 Goal: Move beyond basics into applied Python.

**Exercises:**

* Learn **NumPy** basics: arrays, slicing, vectorized math.
* Learn **Pandas** basics: DataFrame, CSV import, filtering.
* Plot a chart with **Matplotlib**.
* Build a **FastAPI** mini-API with 1-2 endpoints.

---

## 🔹 Phase 9 – Capstone Project (Choose 1)

👉 Goal: Consolidate everything into one bigger project.

**Ideas:**

1. **Personal Journal App**

   * Save entries with date/time.
   * Search entries by keyword.
   * Export to CSV/JSON.

2. **Simple Data Dashboard**

   * Load CSV data with Pandas.
   * Show summary statistics.
   * Plot graphs with Matplotlib.

3. **Mini Web App**

   * Flask/FastAPI backend.
   * Serve data (like a TODO list or blog).
   * Store data in SQLite.
