# List: ordered, mutable, allow duplicate elements, allow diff type, use index
	- when copy a list, ( list_cpy = list_org ) both list refer to the same list inside the memory, fix: list_cpy = list_org.copy()
	- creating new list from an existing list with expression: list_new = [i*i for i in list_old]

# Tuple : ordered, immutable, allow duplicate elements, allow diff type, use index

# Dictionary: key-value pairs, unordered, mutable

# Set : unordered, mutable, no duplicates

# String : ordered, immutable, text prepresentation 

# Collections: Counter, namedtuple, orderedDict, defaultDict, deque
- deque: can add or remove elements from both side

# Itertools : a collection of tools for handling iterators

#Terminologies
- Immutable : means cannot be changed after it’s created, cannot add / remove / modify existing elements
- Concatenate : to join things together in order, end-to-end
- at Runtime : When the program is actually running (executing) — after you press Run or start the program. Ex: zero division err
- at Compiletime : Happens before the program runs, things checked: syntax err, type checking, missing var/func. Ex: syntax err
