# List: ordered, mutable, allow duplicate elements, allow diff type, use index
	- when copy a list, ( list_cpy = list_org ) both list refer to the same list inside the memory, fix: list_cpy = list_org.copy()
	- creating new list from an existing list with expression: list_new = [i*i for i in list_old]

# Tuple : ordered, immutable, allow duplicate elements, allow diff type, use index
